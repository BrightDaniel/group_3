 Write a shell script to check to see if the file “file_path” exists. 
 If it does exist, display “file_path passwords are enabled.”
 Next, check to see if you can write to the file. If you can, display “You have permissions to edit “file_path.””
 If you cannot, display “You do NOT have permissions to edit “file_path””
